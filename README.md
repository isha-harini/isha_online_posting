Script for posting to free websites 
You will need to install the following onto your computer before running the script:
  1. Python - Install the python package .. not the snake. The scripting language ;-)
  2. Selenium - this is the package that helps us interact with the websites
  3. Chromedriver - this package helps selenium to interact with chrome. You could install firefox/any other browser driver instead - in which case you have to modify the script. So, unless you have a strong reason not to use Chrome, just stick with it.
  
  These are the packages we needed to run on a Mac. Running on Windows may have different requirements..
  
  We run it on the Terminal for Mac. You might have to run it on Command Prompt or download a csh shell to run on Windows. We can make this a Windows executable -- that is future work.
  
  After all packages are installed, to run the script just type 
      python online_script.py
